🏠 Real Estate & Housing Price Analysis Dashboard – 2025

I’m excited to share my latest **Power BI Dashboard**, designed for **analyzing housing market trends and property valuation factors**. 

This project focuses on identifying how features like **area, furnishing status, and amenities** impact the final price of a property.


📂 Dataset Used <a href ="https://github.com/Kishangpt0708/Real_Estate-Housing_Analysis_PowerBi_Dashboard/blob/main/Real_Estate-Housing_Analysis_Excel.csv">Dataset View </a>

(Contains data on Property Prices, Area size, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, and Amenities like AC, Basement, Parking, etc.)



🔑 Key Insights at a Glance

✅ **Price Drivers:** Correlation between **Area (sq ft)** and **Price** (Do larger homes always cost more?).

✅ **Amenity Value:** Impact of **Air Conditioning**, **Main Road Access**, and **Guest Rooms** on property valuation.

✅ **Furnishing Trends:** Price comparison between **Furnished, Semi-Furnished, and Unfurnished** houses.

✅ **Structural Analysis:** How the number of **Stories** (1-4) and **Bathrooms** influences the market value.

✅ **Premium Locations:** Identifying if properties in a **"Preferred Area"** (prefarea) command a significantly higher price.

This dashboard includes:

* **Interactive Scatter Plots** visualizing the relationship between Area and Price with clustering capabilities.
* **Dynamic Slicers** to filter properties by **Bedrooms**, **Bathrooms**, and **Furnishing Status**.
* **Tree Maps** showing the distribution of property counts by Price Range.
* **DAX Measures** calculating the "Average Price per Sq Ft" and "Premium Amenity Lift" (percentage increase in price for AC/Parking).
* **Q&A Feature** enabling users to ask questions like "Show average price by furnishing status".

It helps real estate agents and homebuyers **estimate property value** and spot undervalued listings.



##🛠 Tools & Skills Used* **Microsoft Power BI** (Dashboarding & Visualization)
* **Power Query** (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** (Calculated measures for Valuation Metrics)
* **Data Modeling** (Categorizing amenities for better filtering)
* **Interactive Navigation** (Drill-downs and Tooltips)



🎯 Project Highlights* **Valuation Logic:** Determining how much value a **Garage/Parking Spot** adds to a house using calculated columns.
* **Feature Comparison:** Analyzing if "Hot Water Heating" is a significant price factor using comparative bar charts.
* **Segmentation:** Breaking down the market into "Luxury" (High Price/High Area) vs. "Budget" segments using conditional formatting.
